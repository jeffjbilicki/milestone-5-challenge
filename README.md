## Understanding Hashing, breathd first, and depth first searching on Graphs

### Exercise One: milestone5/m5-bfs.py
 
 Think about various application of BFS when doing this programming exercise:
 - web crawling (how Google finds pages)
 - social networking (Facebook friend finder)
 - network broadcast routing
 - garbage collection
 - model checking (finite state machine)
 - checking mathematical conjectures
 - solving puzzles and games
    
### Exercise Two: milestone5/m5-dfs.py
   
What is the difference between a breathd first and depth first search? 
  
  
When completing the programing exercise remember the following:  
 - follow path until you get stuck
 - backtrack along breadcrumbs until reach unexplored neighbor
 - recursively explore
 - careful not to repeat a vertex   
    
    
### Bonus 

Write a hashing algorithm in python and calculate its load factor
